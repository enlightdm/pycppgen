# pycppgen

## Overview
`pycppgen` is a Python script designed to parse and generate C++ code based on user-defined tags. By embedding specific tags within your C++ code, the script dynamically generates reflection-ready templates and attributes to streamline your development workflow.

## Features
- **Tag-Based Code Generation**: Add `$[[pycppgen]]` or `$[[pycppgen <flags>]]` after a declaration in your C++ code to generate a `pycppgen<declaration type>` template.
- **Reflection Support**: Includes both basic reflection and user-provided attributes to enhance metadata management.

## Motivation
This project was created as:
1. A learning exercise to explore Python programming.
2. A solution to improve reflection mechanisms within my Vulkan framework: [VkFramework](https://leobenaducci.visualstudio.com/VkFramework).

## Planned Features
The project is a work in progress, and additional features are planned for future updates:
- Enhanced template reflection capabilities.
- Support for function reflection.
- Reflection for global and static variables.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/<your-repo-name>.git](https://github.com/leobenaducci/pycppgen.git)
   ```
2. Run the Python script on your C++ files:
   ```bash
   python main.py <input-file> <options>
   ```
3. Add `$[[pycppgen]]` or `$[[pycppgen <flags>]]` tags in your C++ code where you want templates to be generated.
